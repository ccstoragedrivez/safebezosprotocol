# SafeBezos Protocol

SafeBezos protocol is a mixture of RFI tokenomics with the added function of auto-liquidity generating protocol. Forked from SafeMoon, our smart contract can be compared side by side with SafeMoon which will show that we did not make any major changes to compromise security. SafeBezos is 100% community owned and driven - no rug is possible.
